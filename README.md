## Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a social media app where users can come together to share their love of cats.  Users can either sign up to share their own cat photos or to view other users' photos and interact with them.  The app provides the features you would expect of a social media app - to share photos, like and comment on them, follow users and be followed.


## User Experience (UX)

## Design

Being a mobile-first responsively designed app, I started with how this app would be optimised for mobile devices.  This dictated the components that would be included and the presentation of them from mobile through to desktop.  For example, the verticle, sequential layout of components for mobile, expanding out horizontally as appropriate for larger screen sizes.  Component elements such as the number of profiles shown in Recommended Profiles, for example, there are four shown on mobile and ten shown on laptops and desktops (although not depicted below due to wireframe limitations).  Responsive design is about ensuring an optimised user experience, no matter the device they are using.

Some of the features have changed since first conception.

### Colour-scheme

Part of the reason for choosing a cat themed app, was to create an app that was aesthetically different to anything I had previously done.  I wanted to create an inviting, cute feeling app.  Therefore, I wanted softer pastel tones, using some primary colours. After some research I settle on the pastel red, blue and green as below.

To add to the cuteness, I also wanted a Japanese kawaii-style (INSERT KAWAII LINK) cat background.  I overlaid this with an opaque filter, to ensure it didn't visually interfere with the content.

### Font

In keeping with the cute theme, I searched Google Fonts for something that would enhance the theme.  I settled on Josefin Sans for it's rounded letters which I felt complemented the rounded components, avatars and background image.

### Icons

Icons were obtained from Font Awesome (INSERT LINK).  I chose familiar social media and navbar icons to ensure an intuitive user interface (UI).  I also used a cat icon to accompany the app title in the navbar.
